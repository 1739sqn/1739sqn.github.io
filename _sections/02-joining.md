- Upon arriving at the sqaudron one of our staff members will give you the joining breif and a tour of the sqaudron as well as assigning you a buddy for the night. You will also be introduced to the remaining staff and cadets.

- You won't have to do parade until confident to do so or until you know how to parade in static and marching.

- If you have a friend or you know someone who is in the squadron you could ask them to take you to the sqaudron.
